## 📌 Problem Statement

Efficient delivery planning is one of the biggest challenges in logistics.  
Unoptimized routing increases fuel costs, delivery time, and operational expenses.

This project solves a real-world inspired **Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP)** with:

- Multiple vehicles
- Delivery demand constraints
- Route optimization
- Interactive route visualization
